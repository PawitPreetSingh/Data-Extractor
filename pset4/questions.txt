0.  JPEG  supports 24 bit color, GIF supports 8 bit color, BMP supports 1, 4, 8,16,24, 32
    PNG supports 8 bit color.
1.  Animation is supported by GIF, BMP
2.  Lossy compression in comparison o Lossless compression tend to loose a lot of information
    during compressing the file. for ex JPEG is lossy while GIF, PNG are lossless
3.  JPEG is lossy compression
4.  Deleting a file most often rewrites the metadata that pointed to the file but
    leaves the disk block containing the file's contents intact
5.  Disk sanitizers and declassifiers ensures complete deletion of a file.
6.  This header defines a set of integral types with specific width requirements 
7.  UInt8 and INT8 stands for unsigned int and signed int with 8 bits or 1 byte
    Signed integers has MSB reserved for signing. so range of signed 8 bit int is 
    -128 to 127 while range of unsigned 8 bit int is o to 255.
8.  BYTE = 8 Bits Unsigned integer(1 Byte), DWORD = 32 Bits unsig int(4 Bytes), LONG 
    is 32-bit signed integer, WORD is 16 bit unsigned integer.
9.  First two bytes of BMP files is 'BM' or in decimal 6677
10. bisize: The nuber of bytes required by the header. bfsize: The file size in bytes
    that contains the DIB(BMP)
11. If biheight is negative it means BMP is top down alligned with top at upper left
12. WORD bibitcount represents color depth
13. NULL may be returned when you don't have permission to use the file or out of memory
14. The third argument is 1 because we only want to read the element once.
15. padding = 1
16. fseek(FILE* fp, int offset, int from_where). Fseek change the offset of the file pointer fp
    offset refers to how many bytes you want to change pos. +ve for forward, -ve for backwards
17. SEEK_CUR: I you want to change position of fp from its current pos
    SEEK_END: sets location to the end of file
    SEEK_SET: sets location to beginning of the file
18. TODO
